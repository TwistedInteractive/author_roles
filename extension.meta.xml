		<release version="1.2" date="2012-10-04" min="2.3">
			Added functionality to hide menu elements created by other extensions. __Important:__ Since extensions can
			not (yet) influence the execution order of extensions in Symphony, you need to apply a tiny little 'hack'
			to Symphony to make sure the 'Author Roles'-extension is executed as last, after all other extensions have
			made their possible modifications to the navigation. Read the readme for more details.

		<release version="1.0" date="2016-05-17" min="2.3" max="2.6.7">
			Updated `...nce()->Author->isD...` to `...nce()->Author()->isD...` per [migration guide](https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/wiki/Migration-Guide-to-2.5-for-Developers#properties).
