			Added functionality to hide menu elements created by other extensions. __Important:__ Since extensions can
			not (yet) influence the execution order of extensions in Symphony, you need to apply a tiny little 'hack'
			to Symphony to make sure the 'Author Roles'-extension is executed as last, after all other extensions have
			made their possible modifications to the navigation. Read the readme for more details.

			Re Written Core Access Functionality
				- Table view now uses filters to narrow down user permissions
				- Entry edit now checks that the user has view/edit permissions before loading the page
				- User is given an entry/section not found if they are not allowed to view/edit the said entry/section
				- Similar Errors are thrown when trying to create, edit and delete entries without the necessary permissions
				- Added ability to use custom field to determine Author
					- Author field uses the author id
					- All other fields match the author name with the value
					- Author field name has to be consistent across all sections
