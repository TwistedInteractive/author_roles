			Added functionality to hide menu elements created by other extensions. __Important:__ Since extensions can
			not (yet) influence the execution order of extensions in Symphony, you need to apply a tiny little 'hack'
			to Symphony to make sure the 'Author Roles'-extension is executed as last, after all other extensions have
			made their possible modifications to the navigation. Read the readme for more details.
